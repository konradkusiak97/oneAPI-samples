# Diamond Dependency Sample

Code example demonstrating the usage of [`sycl_ext_oneapi_graph`](https://github.com/intel/llvm/blob/sycl/sycl/doc/extensions/experimental/sycl_ext_oneapi_graph.asciidoc) extension with queue recording API.

|:---                       |:---
| What you will learn       | How to use SYCL-Graphs extension for optimizing kernel execution.
| Time to complete          | 15 minutes


## Purpose

This code example shows how a SYCL queue can be put into a recording state, which allows a `command_graph` object to be populated by the command-groups submitted to the queue. Once the graph is complete, recording finishes on the queue to put it back into the default executing state. The graph is then finalized so that no more nodes can be added. Lastly, the graph is submitted in its entirety for execution via `handler::ext_oneapi_graph(command_graph<graph_state::executable>)`.

|:---                               |:---
| OS                                | Linux* Ubuntu* <br>Windows* 10, 11
| Hardware                          | Intel GPU
| Software                          | Intel® oneAPI DPC++/C++ Compiler


## Key Implementation Details

Key SYCL* concepts demonstrated in the code sample include using command graph extension with buffers and accessors. This sample is using queue recording API.

>**Note**: For comprehensive information about oneAPI programming, see the *[Intel® oneAPI Programming Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/current/overview.html)*. (Use search or the table of contents to find relevant information quickly.)


## Set Environment Variables

When working with the command-line interface (CLI), you should configure the oneAPI toolkits using environment variables. Set up your CLI environment by sourcing the `setvars` script every time you open a new terminal window. This practice ensures that your compiler, libraries, and tools are ready for development.

> **Note**: You can use [Modulefiles scripts](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/current/use-modulefiles-with-linux.html) to set up your development environment. The modulefiles scripts work with all Linux shells.

> **Note**: If you want only specific components or versions of those components, use a [setvars config file](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/current/use-a-config-file-for-setvars-sh-on-linux-or-macos.html) to set up your development environment.


## Build the `Diamond Dependency` Sample for CPU and GPU

> **Note**: If you have not already done so, set up your CLI
> environment by sourcing  the `setvars` script in the root of your oneAPI installation.
>
> Linux*:
> - For system wide installations: `. /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For private installations: ` . ~/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh`
> - For non-POSIX shells, like csh, use the following command: `bash -c 'source <install-dir>/setvars.sh ; exec csh'`
>
> Windows*:
> - `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat`
> - Windows PowerShell*, use the following command: `cmd.exe "/K" '"C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\setvars.bat" && powershell'`
>
> For more information on configuring environment variables or if you have a Unified Directory Layout, see
*[Use the setvars and oneapi-vars Scripts with Linux*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/current/use-the-setvars-script-with-linux-or-macos.html)* or *[Use the setvars and oneapi-vars Scripts with Windows*](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/programming-guide/current/use-the-setvars-script-with-windows.html)*.

### On Linux*

The project uses a standard CMake build configuration system. Ensure the SYCL compiler is used by the configuration either by setting the environment variable `CXX=<compiler>` or passing the configuration flag
`-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler>` where `<compiler>` is your SYCL compiler's
executable (for example Intel `icpx` or LLVM `clang++`).

1. Change to the sample directory.
2. Build the program.
   ```
   mkdir -p build && cd build
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<compiler>
   cmake --build .
   ```

The CMake configuration automatically detects the available SYCL backends and
enables the SPIR/CUDA/HIP targets for the device code, including the corresponding 
architecture flags. If desired, these auto-configured cmake options may be overridden 
with the following ones:

| OPTION                     | VALUE 
|:---                        |:---
| ENABLE_SPIR                | ON or OFF
| ENABLE_CUDA                | ON or OFF
| ENABLE_HIP                 | ON or OFF
| CUDA_COMPUTE_CAPABILITY    | Integer, e.g. `70` meaning capability 7.0 (arch `sm_70`)
| HIP_GFX_ARCH               | String, e.g. `gfx1030`

#### Troubleshooting

If an error occurs, you can get more details by running `make` with
the `VERBOSE=1` argument:
```
make VERBOSE=1
```
If you receive an error message, troubleshoot the problem using the **Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits**. The diagnostic utility provides configuration and system checks to help find missing dependencies, permissions errors, and other issues. See the *[Diagnostics Utility for Intel® oneAPI Toolkits User Guide](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/oneapi/user-guide-diagnostic-utility/current/overview.html)* for more information on using the utility.
